= Bndly features bndly-felix-base-feature

This is a lightweight feature of Apache Felix including webconsole.

You can launch it with
 mvn install -Plaunch
and point your webbrowser on http://loclhost:8080/system/console (admin/admin) to see it working.

As you can't do much with a bare Felix other than deploy your own bundles to see them working the main reason for this feature is inclusion in other features by using the aggregate-features section of slingfeature-maven-plugin.
